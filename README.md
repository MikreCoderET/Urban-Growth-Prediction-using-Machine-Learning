# Urban-Growth-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
A Capstone Project: Urban Growth Prediction using Machine Learning. This project uses a Random Forest model on Sentinel-2 imagery to predict urban expansion in Bilbao, Spain. It achieved over 90% accuracy, producing a land cover map and a crucial "Urban Risk Map" to inform sustainable urban planning. This work directly supports SDG 11 and 13.
